# Basic Calculator Program

## Overview
This is a simple Python program that functions as a basic calculator. The user inputs two numbers and an arithmetic operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and the program performs the corresponding calculation.

## Features
- Accepts user input in the order: number → operator → number.
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Handles invalid inputs (non-numeric values and unsupported operators).
- Prevents division by zero errors.

## How to Use
1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter the first number when prompted.
3. Enter an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`).
4. Enter the second number.
5. The program calculates and displays the result.

## Example Usage
```
Enter first number: 10
Enter operation (+, -, *, /): +
Enter second number: 5
Result: 10 + 5 = 15
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Running the Program
To run the script, use the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```
python calculator.py
```

## Error Handling
- If a non-numeric value is entered, the program displays an error message.
- If an invalid operator is entered, the program prompts the user to use a valid one.
- Division by zero is not allowed and will return an error message.
